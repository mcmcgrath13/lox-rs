# Lox in Rust

Lox is the toy language used in the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) book.  This is the first implementation of that language.  The book uses Java for this implementation, but I have elected to do this implementation in Rust.

## Usage

Start a lox REPL
```
cargo run
```

Run a lox file
```
cargo run [file.lox]
```
